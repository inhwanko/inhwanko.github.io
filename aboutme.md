I'm a Ph.D. student in political science at the University of Washington, Seattle. I graduated from Yonsei University in South Korea where I was born and raised. My research interests are international environmental cooperation, political economy of climate change, and social (justice) movement. My methodological focuses are panel data analysis and text-as-data. Currently, I'm working with [Prof. Aseem Prakash](https://www.polisci.washington.edu/people/aseem-prakash) and a Duck Familiy Graduate Fellow at [the Center for Environmental Politics](https://depts.washington.edu/envirpol/).

I like to ponder on these questions:

- How do goverments translate global public goods (e.g. greenhouse gas reduction) into their local benefits (e.g. job creation, economic boost, votes, etc)?
- How do political and economic actors influence their governments (and foreign ones) to adopt more active (or passive) climate change policy?
- Among what political and economic actors does the cooperation on climate technology arise and why?
- Why do new political groups in climate negotiation (e.g. AILAC) arise and to what extent are they different from (similiar with) conventional regional bloc-based groups (e.g. EU)?
- Why do governments choose a specific policy design for pricing carbon, and how do these variants of carbon pricing vary in their performance?
- Under what conditions do social movements change the behavior of political actors (government, congress, and court)?
- How to measure the level of party polarization from legislative speeches and bills?
